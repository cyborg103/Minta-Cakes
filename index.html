  <a id="ourstory"><p class="headline">OUR STORY</p></a>

  <p> We began our wonderful journey in Wollongong, Australia, from a small and cozy family bakery in the early 1970&#39;s. From generation to generation, our family, the Minta, has preserved a secret recipe for our savoury cakes. They were beloved by everyone in the neighbourhood. Our reputation grew, and MINTA CAKES is now the Australians&#39; love and pride.</p>
  <p>Big as it is, we do not offer a wide variety of choices. We only have two types of cakes:</p>
  <p style="color:#b30000">&hearts; &nbsp;<strong>Season&Time</strong>&nbsp; &hearts;<br>With four flavours (or Seasons) &#45; Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring;<br>and two designs (or Times) &#45; Day and Night</p>
  <p style="color:#b30000">&hearts; &nbsp;<strong>Crystal Sea</strong>&nbsp; &hearts;<br>A traditional specialty</p>
  <p>This seeming disadvantage turns out to be our mysteriously powerful attraction.<br>It maybe because each of our cakes keeps inside a whole dreamy season, and time, and tears,<br>and sea, and love... It is like they have their own stories, their own lives.</p>
