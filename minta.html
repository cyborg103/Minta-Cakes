    <div class="center-paragraph">
      We began our wonderful journey in Wollongong, Australia, from a small and cozy family bakery in the early 1970&#39;s. From generation to generation, our family, the Minta, has preserved a secret recipe for our savoury cakes. We offer two types of cakes:
      <p><span style="color:#8c0000">&hearts; &nbsp;</span><strong><em>Season&Time</em></strong><span style="color:#8c0000">&nbsp; &hearts;</span><br>With four Seasons &#45; Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring;<br>and two Times &#45; Day and Night<br>
        <span style="color:#8c0000">&hearts; &nbsp;</span><strong><em>Crystal Sea</em></strong><span style="color:#8c0000">&nbsp; &hearts;</span><br>A traditional specialty</p>
      Each keeps inside a whole dreamy season, and time, and tears, and sea, and love... Each has its own story, its own life.
